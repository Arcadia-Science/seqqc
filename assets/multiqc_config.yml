  This report has been generated by the <a href="https://github.com/Arcadia-Science/seqqc" target="_blank">Arcadia-Science/seqqc</a> analysis pipeline. 
  The purpose of this pipeline is to rapidly assess the quality of new sequencing data so that you can feel confident depositing it into an <a href="https://www.insdc.org/" target="_blank">INSDC database</a> like the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home" target="_blank">European Nucleotide Archive</a> rapidly after data generation.
  In typical academic settings, data would be deposited in a an INSDC database at time of publication, so any quality issues with the data itself would be caught during the analysis. 
  The seqqc pipeline was designed to perform minimum quality control reporting so that data could be posted more closely at time of generation, but also so that quality problems would still be caught prior to deposition. 
  The pipeline is designed to report technical sequencing issues via FastQC, sample similarity with sourmash compare, and potential contamination with sourmash gather. 
  Because this pipeline is designed to run on any type of raw sequencing data, it is purely descriptive and you will need to rely on a combination of your domain specific expertise, the section descriptions, and the results to determine whether there is a quality issue with your sequencing data or not. 
  For information about how to interpret these results, please consult each section of this document.

    Sourmash compare estimates sample similarity using angular similarity. 
    Angular similarity takes both shared sequence content and sequence abundance information into account when estimating similarity.
    Shared sequence content is measured using the intersection over the union of k-mers (<i>k</i> = 21) in each sample.
    About 1/1000th of all distinct k-mers are used to estimate similarity.
    Sequence similarity scores range from 0 to 1 and samples that are more similar will have higher value.
    Note that because this module runs on raw sequencing data, sequencing errors will falsely deflate similarity estimates but should still provide relatively good estimates.
    This module is designed to highlight mislabelled samples or to catch technical artifacts that might lead to outlying replicate samples.
    Replicates or biologically similar samples should have the highest similarity scores.
    Samples are alphabetically ordered on the X and Y axis of the heatmap, and each square represents the similarity score between the intersecting samples.
    You can run your mouse over each heatmap square to highlight the similarity value.
