  This report has been generated by the <a href="https://github.com/Arcadia-Science/seqqc" target="_blank">Arcadia-Science/seqqc</a>
  analysis pipeline. The purpose of this pipeline is to rapidly assess the quality of new sequencing data so that you can feel 
  confident depositing it into an <a href="https://www.insdc.org/" target="_blank">INSDC database</a> like the 
  <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home" target="_blank">European Nucleotide Archive</a> rapidly after data generation.
  In typical academic settings, data would be deposited in a an INSDC database at time of publication, so any quality issues with
  the data itself would be caught during the analysis. The seqqc pipeline was designed to perform minimum quality control reporting
  so that data could be posted more closely at time of generation, but also so that quality problems would still be caught prior to 
  deposition. The pipeline is designed to report technical sequencing issues via FastQC, sample similarity with sourmash compare, 
  and potential contamination with sourmash gather. Because this pipeline is designed to run on any type of raw sequencing data, it 
  is purely descriptive and you will need to rely on a combination of your domain specific expertise, the section descriptions, 
  and the results to determine whether there is a quality issue with your sequencing data or not. For information about how to 
  interpret these results, please consult each section of this document.
